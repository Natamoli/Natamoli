## About me

- ⭐ Postman Star ⭐
- 🐛 Web & mobile manual Testing
- 📲 API Process Automation
- 💻 Tech Lover | QA Engineer | Curious Mind

🔭 I recently completed my QA Engineering Bootcamp at TripleTen, and I’m excited to keep growing and putting my skills into action.

🌱 Right now, I’m practicing test automation with Selenium and have already worked on projects using SQL and Python (Pytest, Requests). I also enjoy working with manual testing tools like Jira, Postman, and Android Studio.

💡 What drives me is facing challenges, learning new things, and finding smart ways to automate and improve processes. I love discovering solutions that make testing more efficient and fun.

✨ Always curious. Always learning. Always improving.
